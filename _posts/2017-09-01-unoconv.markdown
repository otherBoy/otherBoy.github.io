#### 1. Install LibreOffice

Universal Office Converter (unoconv) is a tool to convert any document format that LibreOffice can import to any document format that LibreOffice can export. Before we use unoconv, we have to install LibreOffice.

Since we cannot use win32com to convert MSword of MSexcel file to pdf on any OS except Windows, unconv is a good solution on Linux or MacOS.

The LibreOffice's official download link: [https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)

__Do not install the newest version. Due to the newest version of unoconv is 0.7, it only support LibreOffice 4.2.5 or before.__

This version works well on MacOS. [https://downloadarchive.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/old/4.2.5.2/mac/x86_64/LibreOffice_4.2.5.2_MacOS_x86-64.dmg](https://downloadarchive.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/old/4.2.5.2/mac/x86_64/LibreOffice_4.2.5.2_MacOS_x86-64.dmg)

#### 2. Install unoconv

There are several ways to install unoconv. Installation by Brew is the best way. Otherwise, you may encounter __Cannot find a suitable pyuno library and python binary combination__ or __can't open file 'unoconv': [Errno 2] No such file or directory__.

```
brew install unoconv --HEAD
```

#### 3. Use unoconv
Unoconv is easy to use. Typically you would convert an ODT(doc, docx, etc) document to PDF by running:

```
unoconv -f pdf some-file.odt
```
